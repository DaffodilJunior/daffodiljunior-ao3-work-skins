Ultraviollett (AO3) and TrojanTeapot (AO3) did all the work, i just copypasted it over together.

To make sure formatting shows up in your fic, create a work skin, copypaste the CSS into it, apply said skin to your fic, then coyppaste individual segments of HTML into your fic with the plain text editor option in ao3. Make sure you modify the placeholders (MIKU) with text you actually want readers to see!

The Minecraft sections are screen reader compatible. Unfortunately, i have no idea how to make the Discord skin work without Show Creator's Style, or function as intended with a screen reader. At the moment i'm just posting Discord segments of my fics separately like a traditional chatfic so simple text to speech can function at least. If you do know CSS, please help.
