Ultraviollett (AO3) and TrojanTeapot (AO3) did all the work, i just copypasted it over together and did some basic tweaking.

To make sure formatting shows up in your fic, create a work skin, copypaste the CSS into it, apply said skin to your fic, then coyppaste individual segments of HTML into your fic with the plain text editor option in ao3. Make sure you modify the placeholders (it's either MIKU or something like INSERT TEXT HERE) with text you actually want readers to see! AO3-specific ones do not require any additional CSS.

/* anything in these types of brackets are CSS comments that won't affect any code (unless you pasted it as html, maybe). */

The Minecraft sections and Google Search Bars are screen reader compatible. Unfortunately, i have no idea how to make the Discord skins work without Show Creator's Style, or function as intended with a screen reader; i mean i guess it works if you ignore the random giant images?????????? At the moment i'm just plannig to post future Discord segments of my fics separately like a traditional chatfic so simple text to speech can function at least. If you do know CSS, please help.

The mobile versions are a fork by yours truly. If you want to modify individual role colors for any of these, just copypaste sections of the CSS regarding that and change the individual hex codes since idk what color you want lmao
